What Is This?
-------------

This is a project find all the VNTR from input string

Language and Tools:
algorithm: 
(IDE: Eclipse)

Background
-----------------------
1. what is VNTR:
wiki:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_number_tandem_repeat 

2. algorithms
1). brute force one using 3 for loops with time O(n^3), space O(n); not efficient
2). Some other algorithms like, time O(n^2) (dynamic programming), time O(nlogn) suffix tree is Ok
3). The optimized one is linear time O(n)
There are lots of articles/reference talking about many different ways chasing linear complexity
